A retail bulk buying platform is the project being presented, and it was created to solve the inefficiencies that retailers encounter when buying goods in large quantities from wholesalers. There is a lack of real-time stock visibility, bulk buying optimization, and insights on popular products on current systems, which results in lost time and orders that cannot be filled because of supply shortages. Through the provision of an intelligent B2B bulk-buying experience, our platform seeks to address these problems.

3. Features & Functionalities:
 The primary features include price comparison and quantity editing capabilities for bulk carts, a dashboard that displays stock and trending products, bulk-optimized product listings with comprehensive information, and an insights dashboard that provides distributor performance metrics and low-stock alerts.
4. Figma UI/UX Design & Prototype:
 the design process that starts with wireframing low-fidelity layouts and ends with high-fidelity designs that feature well chosen color schemes, typography, and interactive prototypes made in Figma that demonstrate smooth platform navigation. 

5 Impact, Conclusion:
 the advantages of the platform, such as enhanced purchase choices, decreased order failures, time savings, and future expansion possibilities via AI integration for individualized suggestions and predictive stock management.
